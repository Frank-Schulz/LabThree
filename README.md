  '24' === 24; false
  '24' == 24; true
  '24' != 24; false   <--- This is false, the operator converts the string to a number for comparison. As both are equal 24 != 24 evaluates to false.

  We continued our coverage on comparison operators and moved into if and switch statements.
  We also learned that objects are compared solely by their id, NOT their contents.
  Switch statements outputs can be given multiple criteria.

   We were given a class activity in which we were to use if and switch statements to return the grade and pass description that a student would get for a given mark.
   At first I confused myself by thinking that we were meant to combine the if and and switch statements, but I later realised that we simply had to use both to provide the outcome. After which I was still able to facilitate the learning of others.
